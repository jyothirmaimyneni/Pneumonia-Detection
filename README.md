# Pneumonia-Detection
Convolution neural network (CNN)  is used for the detection of pneumonia with the help of x-ray images.For classification of the images, softmax is used along  with the ReLU activation function.For the pre-processing of the images, Knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) is used.
We used gray scaling, gaussian blur and changing the image into histogram for pre-processing.
CNN RESNET-50 is a Convolutional neural network with resnet(Residual network-50). 50 in the resnet -50 refers to the number of layers present in the network. CNN RESNET-50 is a deep neural network which can classify images into various categories.
